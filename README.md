# 🛡️ **DoS & DDoS Attack Simulation with Mitigation System**

---

## **1. Introduction**

The **DoS & DDoS Attack Simulation with Mitigation System** is a Python-based cybersecurity project that demonstrates how different types of network attacks can be simulated and how a defensive system can detect, log, and respond to these attacks in real time.  
This project provides practical understanding of networking, multithreading, socket programming, and security monitoring.

---

## **2. Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:

- To simulate common cyber attacks such as **DoS, DDoS, SYN Flood, SQL Injection, and UDP Flood**.
- To design a **real-time mitigation system** that detects and logs attacks.
- To understand **client-server communication** using socket programming.
- To develop user-friendly **GUI applications** using Tkinter.
- To demonstrate the use of **multithreading** for concurrent operations.

4. System Design
4.1 Architecture

Client–Server Model

Attacker (Client):

Generates simulated attacks

Scans network IP addresses

Provides attack control interface

Mitigator (Server):

Listens on port 9999

Detects incoming attacks

Logs and displays attack information

Generates downloadable reports

4.2 Workflow

Start the Mitigator server

Attacker scans the local network

User selects attack type

Attacker sends attack signal

Mitigator logs and displays the attack

5. Features
🧨 Attacker Application

GUI-based control panel

Supports multiple attack types

Network IP scanner

Multi-threaded ping scanning

Saves previous IP for reuse

Clean modern interface

🛡️ Mitigator Application

Real-time attack detection

Live attack monitoring

Automatic log file generation

Downloadable reports

Scrollable attack history

Auto-start server option

6. Testing
Test Case	Expected Outcome	Result
Server startup	Server starts correctly	✅ Pass
Attack transmission	Attack delivered to Mitigator	✅ Pass
Log generation	Logs recorded properly	✅ Pass
GUI update	Logs displayed in real time	✅ Pass
File saving	Logs saved to Desktop	✅ Pass
Multithreading	Stable concurrent operation	✅ Pass
7. Sample Attack Log
